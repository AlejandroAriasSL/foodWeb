                            <li>Add olive oil, water, and flour to the bowl. Mix until a dough forms, then knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 3-4 minutes. Transfer the dough to a bowl and let it ferment for 1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
                            <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and divide it into two pieces of 500 grams each, trying not to deflate them too much. Shape them into balls and let them rest for 15 minutes, covered with a cloth.</li>
                            <li>Cover a tray with parchment paper and a bit of wheat flour, then place one ball on top. Gradually pull the edges outward, shaping it into a circle, until it reaches 25 cm in diameter. Repeat with the other ball, then let them rest for 30 minutes at room temperature, or until it puffs up and returns to shape when pressed with a finger.</li>
                            <li>Mix the ingredients for the glazing and brush the entire surface. Then, create a pattern with the tips of your fingers following the instructions in the video. Finally, sprinkle sesame seeds all over the surface.</li>
